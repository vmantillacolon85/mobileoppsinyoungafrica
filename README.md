Population Insights

The world population growth rate peaked in 1963 at 2.2% per year and subsequently declined.  In 2017, the estimated annual growth rate was 1.1%.

The CIA World Factbook gives the world annual birthrate, mortality rate, and growth rate as 1.86%, 0.78%, and 1.08% respectively.

The last 100 years have seen a massive fourfold increase in the population, due to medical advances, lower mortality rates, and an increase in agricultural productivity made possible by the Green Revolution.

By 2100, the UN projects the population in Sub-Saharan Africa will reach 3.8 billion.

The main driver of long-term future population growth is projected to be the evolution of the global average fertility rate.
